# rigtrans
Transceiver Rig CAT Translator.   A basic script for translating the rig commands from software that may noy currently handle their rig.  I encounted this requirement when using the WinLink RMS Trimode as it did not support Yaesu FT991.  I was able to configure it to use Kenwood TS2000 which is common and the translator translated the required commands to that of the FT991.  Hopefully the script can help others out until the software they are using eventually supports their rig.
