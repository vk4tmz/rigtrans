# rigtrans
Transceiver Rig CAT Translator.   A basic tool for translating the rig commands from software that may not handle your rig.  I had this requirement with the WinLink RMS Trimode did not support Yaesu FT991, so I was able to configure it to use Kenwood TS2000 which is common and the translator translated the required commands to that of the FT991.  Hopefully the script can help others out until the software they are using eventually supports their rig.
